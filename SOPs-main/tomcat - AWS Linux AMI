# Step 1: Launch an instance
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in Setting up to use Amazon EC2.
- Once you have ec2 running change the security group inbound rules
- Type = SSH : Protocol = TCP : port range = 22 : source = anywhere ipv4
- Type = Custom TCP : Protocol = TCP : port range = 8080 : source = anywhere ipv4

# Step 2: Install Java

Login to your EC2 via putty / Mobaxterm

Switch to root
sudo su

Install java
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y

Validate installed java version
java -version
You should be able to see java version as “openjdk version “1.8.0_342”

Switch to /opt (try installing all tools and plugins on /opt) 
cd /opt/
ll

# Step 3: Install tomcat

Download tomcat from the apache site (yum install wget -> if you see a wget command not found error)
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.106/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.106.tar.gz

As soon as the tomcat download is complete, run
ll 
You should see apache-tomcat-7.0.106.tar.gz
run tar -xvf apache-tomcat-7.0.106.tar.gz to unzip the file
ll

Now you will see an unzipped file apache-tomcat-7.0.106
Rename the file using the below command -> 
mv apache-tomcat-7.0.106 tomcat
ll -> you should now see apache-tomcat-7.0.106 changed to tomcat.
cd /tomcat
cd /bin
sh startup.sh (to start tomcat)

Now fetch public IP from AWS console and login to tomcat via browser
http://<your ec2 public IP>:8080

You should see your tomcat URL launch and home page - 

Setup user account to access tomcat

On your ec2, switch to cd conf/
vim tomcat-users.xml
Scroll down to the bottom one line above </tomcat-users>

- Press ‘i’ you will be on insert mode.
- Copy and paste <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
- As you made changes under conf/ you need to restart tomcat by using below steps
- cd bin/
- sh shutdown.sh
- sh startup.sh

Relaunch http://<your ec2 public IP>:8080 and login using below credentials

-> username = tomcat
-> password = tomcat
