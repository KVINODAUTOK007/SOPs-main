📝 **Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu**

To install Jenkins on Ubuntu, follow the steps below:

   - Ensure that you have SSH access to the instance.

2. **Update the System**:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.
   - Run the following command to update the package lists:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     ```

3. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Run the following command to install OpenJDK 11 JRE:
     ```
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
     ```
   - Verify the Java installation by checking the version:
     ```
     java -version
     ```

4. **Add Jenkins Repository Key**:
   - Run the following command to download and add the Jenkins repository key:
     ```
     curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
     ```
   - Add the Jenkins repository key to the system:
     ```
     echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
     ```

5. **Update and Install Jenkins**:
   - Update the package lists again to include the Jenkins repository:
     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     ```
   - Install Jenkins using the following command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install jenkins
     ```

6. **Enable and Start Jenkins Service**:
   - Enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot:
     ```
     sudo systemctl enable jenkins
     ```
   - Start the Jenkins service:
     ```
     sudo systemctl start jenkins
     ```
   - Check the status of the Jenkins service to ensure it is running:
     ```
     sudo systemctl status jenkins
     ```

7. **Retrieve Jenkins Initial Admin Password**:
   - Retrieve the initial admin password generated by Jenkins:
     ```
     sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
     ```
   - Copy the password and save it for later use.

Congratulations! Jenkins is now successfully installed on your Ubuntu EC2 instance. You can access the Jenkins web interface by opening a web browser and entering the IP address or hostname of your EC2 instance, followed by port 8080 (e.g., http://your-instance-ip:8080/). Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Jenkins setup process.
