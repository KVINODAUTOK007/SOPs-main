# Open a terminal or command prompt.

# Type the following command to start the AWS CLI configuration process.
aws configure

# The command will prompt you to enter your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region name, and default output format. 
# Replace <your access key ID>, <your secret access key>, and <your preferred region> with your actual values.
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <your access key ID>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <your secret access key>
Default region name [None]: <your preferred region>
Default output format [None]: json

# If you don't know your preferred region, you can leave it blank and the AWS CLI will use the default region specified in your AWS configuration file.

# After you've entered your values, the command will save your configuration to the `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` files.

# You can confirm that the configuration has been successfully saved by running the following command:

cat ~/.aws/config

# This command should display your AWS configuration details.

# You can also check that the AWS CLI is working correctly by running the following command:

aws ec2 describe-instances

# This command should display a list of your EC2 instances, assuming that you have some instances in your AWS account.
